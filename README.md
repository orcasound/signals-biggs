Releases of acoustic signals, nomenclature, and catalogs for Bigg's killer whales of the Salish Sea.


Before we can build a simple catalog/ue of calls and other signals commonly made by Bigg's killer whales in the Salish Sea, we need to identify, group, and name the signals. Starting with pulsed calls, let's share and discuss resources, open audio recordings, and existing nomenclature. Over time, perhaps we can reach consensus about a suite of clips for a catalog, the labels for each call example, and an optimal way to present both within an online, open catalog/ue.

**Some preliminary open sources of Bigg's audio recordings:**

1. John Ford's contribution to Orcasound's open data archives:[Thomsen examples of T01, T07, and T08](https://orcasound.net/data/raw/transients-Ford/96-08-25/) from 1996 (Aug 25, Numas Island, BC; individuals T14 and T15)
2. [Orcasound's archive of Bigg's recordings](https://orcasound.net/data/product/biophony/Biggs/) (Dabob Bay contribution from US Navy; bouts from Orcasound hydrophones)
3. Scott's [descriptive names for calls clipped from the Dabob Bay recording](https://orcasound.net/data/product/biophony/Biggs/dabob-transient-calls/)
4. Orcasound [blog posts tagged analyzing Bigg's bouts](https://www.orcasound.net/category/biggs/)

**Proposed labels for Bigg's signals:**

Calls? Clicks? Whistles? Percussives? Other?

Some ideas for Orcasound are emerging in this [shared Google spreadsheet seeking label consistency across open annotations of killer whale sounds](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pskIEYjIVQH0IPa10UBuAZHKaGsxs02_itSIZ1Z7oAw/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

**Optimal online catalog ideas:**

- Follow the HALLO SRKW catalog?
- Follow the SRKW call catalogs generated by Orcasound?
- Follow the Orcasound catalogs for SRKW whistles, SRKW clicks, and/or humpback non-song vocalization?
